# CSCI-567-Machine-Learning-
This repo contains my code and problem set submissions for machine learning (CSCI 567) at USC. A significant portion of the code was written by course producers at USC in order to facilitate learning. For instance, classes are structured by the course producers, but class instantiations were coded by the student.
